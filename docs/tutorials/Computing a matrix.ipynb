Try to move then the third point (change its position) to see if something changes. You will see that nothing changes. This is because `BasisMatrixReadout` is the rawest matrix generating module. It simply **trusts that the inputs contain all the important information** and just combines the inputs to generate the matrix. More complex subclasses of `BasisMatrixReadout` might use edge distances and directions, etc...\n",

You will discover that **`BasisMatrixReadout` is an equivariant function**."
