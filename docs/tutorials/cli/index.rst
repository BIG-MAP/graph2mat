CLI tutorials
-------------------

These tutorials show you how to **get your hands dirty** using the built-in models
through the Command Line Interface (CLI).

**Applications are the main focus** of these tutorials. Implementation details
are not discussed. If you are interested in developing your own thing, or just
curious to see what's behind the curtain, see the `Python API tutorials <../python_api/index.rst>`_.
