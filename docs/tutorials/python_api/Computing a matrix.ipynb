    "- From the previous point, you will conclude that the reason there's something special is because the structure is symmetric. Try to move then the third point (change its position) to see if something changes. You will see that nothing changes. This is because we have used `E3nnGraph2Mat` with its simplest settings, its defaults (block operations `E3nnSimpleNodeBlock` and `E3nnSimpleEdgeBlock`). It simply **trusts that the inputs contain all the important information** and combines them to generate the matrix. More complex block operations that use edge distances, directions, etc... can be used within `E3nnGraph2Mat`, see its documentation to understand how.\n",
    "- As a conclusion from the previous point, we can extract that **if we change the inputs, that should induce changes in the matrix**. Try to change our fake `get_environment_representation` function, keeping in mind that the first number is a scalar and the other three a vector. Maybe **try to rotate the vector** and see what happens. You will discover that `E3nnGraph2Mat` **is an equivariant function**."
