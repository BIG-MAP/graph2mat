Training and predicting matrices
-------------------

These tutorials show you how to get your hands dirty using the built-in models.

The focus of these tutorials is on practical usage, so the details behind the models will not be discussed.
See the `Low level tutorials <../low_level/index.rst>`_ if you want to understand the inner workings or build
your own models. Note that you don't need to know the details of the models to use them.
