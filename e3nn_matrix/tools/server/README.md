The server module implements:
- A server to serve predictions of already trained models (Using FastAPI).
- A very simple api client to interact easily with the server from python.
- A very simple frontend for a graphical interface with the server. `frontend/templates`
contains the templates for html files, which are filled and served by the server itself.
