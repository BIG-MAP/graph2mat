"""Implements classes to store an example of the dataset in memory.

A "configuration" is an object that contains all the information about a
given example in the dataset. It contains all the features needed to
describe the example (e.g. coordinates, lattice vectors...), and optionally
the matrix that corresponds to this example.

In a typical case, your configurations will contain the matrix as a label
for training, validating or testing. When doing inference, the configurations
will not have an associated matrix, since the matrix is what you are trying
to calculate.
